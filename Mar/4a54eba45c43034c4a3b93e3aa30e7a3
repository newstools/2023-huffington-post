The Oscar for the most awkward red carpet interview goes to … Hugh Grant appeared to be completely over the very concept of a red carpet interview while being interviewed by Ashley Graham at the 2023 Academy Awards Sunday night. The Love Actually star seemed to have no love for questions like: But things really seemed to take a turn for the worse (er, worser?) when the model asked Hugh about his very memorable cameo in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery. In the film, Grant plays Benoit Blanc’s (Daniel Craig) husband, revealing the detective is gay. “Well, I’m barely in it. I’m in it for three seconds,” Hugh told Ashley when she asked about how he felt about his role.  “Yeah, but still, you showed up and had fun, right?” poor Ashley attempted.  “Uh, almost,” Hugh responded. Graham, realising that she’s going to get absolutely nothing out of this exchange, wrapped things up, then thanked Hugh for his time.  “It was nice to talk to you,” Ashley said, prompting Hugh to look away, make a flustered face and seemingly roll his eyes. Twitter users also had a lot to say about the interview. Check out their comments below:
