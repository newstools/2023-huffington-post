Harry Styles caused a major stir among his fans on Sunday night when he posted – and then swiftly removed – a gym selfie on his Instagram story. The post-workout snap saw the As It Was singer posing in a One Direction tour t-shirt from their world jaunt over a decade ago, but his followers had to be quick if they wanted to catch a glimpse of it, as it disappeared from the internet shortly afterwards. Fans of the star were quick to speculate as to exactly what Harry was up to, and he’s now set the record straight on stage in New Zealand.

And maybe one day, you accidentally post it to your Instagram Story.” Last month, Harry made headlines when he gave a shout-out to his former bandmates during his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards, where he picked up Best British Album for his third solo effort, Harry’s House. “I want to thank my mum for signing me up for X Factor without telling me – I literally would not be here without you,” he said, before adding: “I want to thank Niall, Louis, Liam and Zayn, because I wouldn’t be here without you either.” Harry is currently Down Under as part of his mammoth Love On Tour world jaunt, which began in September 2021, and will end with a final European leg beginning in May, with the final performance of the tour scheduled for July. Since the tour began, Harry has released his third album, which was the surprise winner of the coveted Album Of The Year prize at the Grammys last month.
