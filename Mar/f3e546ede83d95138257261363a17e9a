Justin Bieber has cancelled the remaining dates on his Justice world tour, which were postponed last year for health reasons. Back in September, Justin announced he was postponing the remainder of his Justice world tour on medical grounds, after previously delaying a string of shows due to a Ramsay Hunt syndrome diagnosis. “After getting offstage the exhaustion overtook me and I realised I need to make my health the priority right now,” Justin told his fans at the time. “So I’m going to take a break from touring right now. I’m going to be OK but I need to take time to rest and get better. Thank you for all your prayers and support throughout all this. I love you all passionately.” The NHS website describes Ramsay Hunt syndrome as a facial nerve disorder “caused by a virus in the facial nerve and is a more severe cause of facial paralysis”. It’s now been revealed that the rest of the Justice tour has been axed. Although Justin – who is celebrating his 29th birthday on Wednesday – is yet to address the cancellation, promoters in Australia and Asia have confirmed shows there will no longer be going ahead. Fans in the UK have also been sharing screenshots of emails telling them that the shows had been cancelled, with many voicing their disappointment at the way they found out the news... Could’ve cried when I opened my Justin Bieber cancelled tour email 😭😭😭 HuffPost UK has contacted Justin Bieber’s publicist for comment. Justin’s Justice World tour was originally supposed to kick off in May 2020, but was postponed twice due to the pandemic. After finally opening in February 2022, the second show of the tour had to be cancelled when the star contracted Covid-19 himself.
