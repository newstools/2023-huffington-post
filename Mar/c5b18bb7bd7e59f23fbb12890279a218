When you’re really struggling to get comfortable in bed, we’re all quick to immediately blame the mattress, and set our sights on having to inevitably save up for a new one. But thankfully, there are actually loads of far less costly ways you can make your bed that bit more cosy, and ensure that you’ve set yourself up well for a good night’s sleep. Whether your neck and back are suffering at the hands of your lumpy and hard sub-par mattress, or you just can’t seem to get your body and mind properly relaxed for bedtime, I’m hopeful that these ideas should make snuggling down to sleep a far more comfortable and quick experience.
