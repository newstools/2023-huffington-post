Russian officers have reportedly refused to fight in the east of Ukraine after facing heavy losses on the battlefield. Ukrainian officials told newspaper the Kyiv Post that senior Russian officers who were previously an elite part of the Moscow’s forces, have rejected orders to continue attacking the Ukrainian town of of Vuhledar. Allegedly, the 155th Naval Infantry Brigade of the Pacific Fleet has suffered around 300 casualties a day over the last three weeks. This Russian marine brigade was originally a leading part of the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine last February, but since then, they’ve been torn apart again and again on the battlefield by their opponents. A think tank, The Institute for the Study of War, believes that the entire battalion has been rebuilt around seven times over the last year, with poorly equipped conscripts filling in the gaps. The troops subsequently still face heavy losses, as videos on social media prove.

It all comes after Russia allegedly lost around 130 tanks and armoured vehicles in the ongoing conflict around Vuhledar. But, this is not the only site where Russia is struggling to make any progress either. Nato has also claimed that Russian losses are much higher than Ukraine’s in Bakhmut, a self-mining town slightly north to Vuhledar. Russia is particularly keen to claim it because it would be able to mount further offensive operations into Ukraine. According to a Nato source who spoke to CNN on Monday, there is a five to one death ratio for Russian to Ukrainian soldiers in this area. The UK’s Ministry of Defence also warned in its daily intelligence briefing on Tuesday: “The Ukrainian defence of Bakhmut continues to degrade forces on both sides. “Over the weekend, Ukrainian forces likely stabilised their defensive perimeter following previous Russian advance into the north of the town.” The MoD then hinted that Ukraine might be struggling too, explaining: “Muddy conditions are likely hampering Ukrainian resupply efforts as they increasingly resort to using unpaved tracks.” Meanwhile, the public disagreements between the mercenaries in the Wagner Group and Russian ministry of defence over the allocations of munitions continue to undermine authority within Russian ranks. The MoD suggested this “highlights the difficulty in sustaining the high levels of personnel and ammunition required to advance with their current tactics”.
