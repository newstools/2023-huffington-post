Tuesday afternoon got off to a stressful start for Eurovision fans around the world, as tickets for this year‚Äôs event finally went on sale. With a total of nine shows to choose from (including rehearsals and semi-finals), thousands of Eurovision devotees descended on Ticketmaster‚Äôs UK site hoping they could get their hands on some tickets to watch this year‚Äôs acts performing live. And, as you might expect, the experience wasn‚Äôt without a few technical mishaps. Here are 39 tweets that perfectly sum up the ups and downs of trying to score Eurovision 2023 tickets... The mere thought of trying to buy Eurovision tickets, where you have to choose between 45 different shows, get ready to spend 7 million pounds regardless and then solve a riddle by a troll under a bridge to get them, has made me very tired Me on the train at 12 o‚Äôclock if I can‚Äôt get enough signal to at least try for Eurovision tickets #Eurovision2023 #Eurovision pic.twitter.com/RMoq6u9OiV Happy #Eurovision tickets day, may the odds be ever in your favour üéüÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/C7MJVosKSZ MY ANXIETY WATCHING THE CLOCK FOR EUROVISION TICKETS LIKE.... pic.twitter.com/9mgEmjPllq of course Ticketmaster has crashed already and eurovision tickets aren't even on sale yet üò° Weren't Internal Server Error in the Romanian national final haha I'm not nervously making shit jokes it's all fine totally fine HELP The Ticketmaster servers when they have to do their one and only job pic.twitter.com/vwD5Z0zMw6 @Ticketmaster just getting 504 error messages for Eurovision - then telling me I‚Äôm timing out due to inactivity - so poor - I wouldn‚Äôt mind there not being tickets but not even able to join the queue because of your server capacity is shoddy I can‚Äôt even get into the lobby on Ticketmaster for Eurovision tickets & it‚Äôs already been 10 minutes they‚Äôll all have gone üò© pic.twitter.com/KDPU8XDotz Genuinely quite impressed at the number of ways Ticketmaster has found to blame me for their website being complete shit. #Eurovision pic.twitter.com/rpr9hFv4xS People trying to get Eurovision tickets#Eurovision2023 #Ticketmaster pic.twitter.com/SvJINeeJHr I must admit I was surprised when the BBC said last week Ticketmaster was being used for Eurovision.I have not been shocked by how it‚Äôs gone.
