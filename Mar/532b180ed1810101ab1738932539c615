Just when we thought we were done cooing over Rihanna and her son’s beautiful shoot for British Vogue – the magazine has only gone and released more footage. On Wednesday, the publication shared behind-the-scenes videos of Rihanna, rapper A$AP Rocky and their son on the set of the photo-shoot, and let’s just say adorable would be a total understatement. In one part of the minute-long video, the pair’s baby – whose name they have chosen not to reveal publicly – is seen playing in between takes, while we also get a look behind the curtain at how some of the iconic shots of mother and son came to be. There’s also a sweet clip of the We Found Love singer’s son taking a snooze in his crib. Rihanna and her baby’s Vogue photo-shoot coincided with the Fenty Beauty founder’s much-anticipated performance at the 2023 Super Bowl. During the show, which included a jam-packed medley of her hits, Rihanna also shared with the world that she and A$AP Rocky are now expecting their second child. After sharing her baby news with the world, the nine-time Grammy winner later revealed that she was pregnant when she posed for British Vogue, although she didn’t know it at the time. In her accompanying interview with the UK-based fashion magazine, Rihanna opened up about how her life has changed since becoming a mother – which struck a chord with many first-time parents.
