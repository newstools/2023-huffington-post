Another weekend has rolled around and after a week of cold, drizzly, and snowy weather, it’s certainly time for a well-deserved treat. But you don’t have to break the bank whilst you’re shopping as I’ve found some huge bargains from big brands such as Philips, Carote, Shark, and Colour Wow. There are great savings to be made on a variety of beauty products from a Vera Wang perfume to a Babyliss air styler, and handy buys, such as a windproof compact umbrella and an overnight lip mask, to help you combat this weather. I’ve also found some clever home gadgets, with massive reductions on a De’Longhi barista-style coffee machine and a 9-in-1 Tefal air fryer. So, what are you waiting for? Get your hands on these deals before it’s too late...
