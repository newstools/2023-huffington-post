We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Is it just me, or has Mother’s Day properly snuck up on us this year? Plus, I’ve been struggling to find any good gifts that’ll definitely come in time, and won’t leave me absolutely broke. But don’t worry — I’m here to help you (and myself) out. After spending a considerable amount of time trawling through the internet, I’m pleased to confirm that it is most definitely possible to source an absolutely brilliant Mother’s Day present — even if you’re not able to splash too much cash. As well as being lovely presents, all of the products in this list cost less than £20 (okay I’ll admit that one item may or may not cost £21.99), and will be with you by the weekend as long as you make sure you select the speediest delivery option.
