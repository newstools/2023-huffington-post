Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s recent love-in on Twitter has sparked a big reaction from fans of The Last Of Us. The two actors play the duo Joel and Ellie in the dystopian drama, based on the video game of the same name, and have made no secret of the affection they share for one another off-screen. Earlier this week, the official Last Of Us Twitter account shared a video of Pedro heaping praise on his young co-star. “Bella Ramsey plays Ellie – I call her Bellie – and she’s my blessing,” Pedro said in the clip. “It was just a match made in heaven, and I love her.” Baby girl Bellie. @bellaramsey #TLOU pic.twitter.com/aGhhOTQMFG Bella agrees: “Our relationship has definitely developed as Joel and Ellie’s relationship has. We’re good buddies.” After the clip was posted, Bella shared it on her own page, writing: “HOW I MISS YOU I really really miss you. My Pedge.” Suffice to say, her comment sparked a big response from fans of The Last Of Us… Bellie and Pedge yall are the cutest friends 😭😭 pic.twitter.com/wqmJdQUAQV STOP IT RIGHF NOW https://t.co/m7h4G2lhKm pic.twitter.com/Qzpk0E7ijD you two are just the best❤️ our ellie and joel👨👧 pic.twitter.com/S9JV30mn7R  my favorite best friends <3 pic.twitter.com/Dhdbmyn6MZ MY PEDGE https://t.co/tv6I0z44aa pic.twitter.com/9G1k8wAMac MY PEDGE 😢 https://t.co/nOorizt2HY pic.twitter.com/i7gdhAGlSS Bellie n Pedge 😭😭 https://t.co/YsjLQihdlG pic.twitter.com/JfR9B7dHAa beldro reunion WHEN pic.twitter.com/1s4tfXJxQH Stop this is so cute 😭 MY FAV FATHER DAUGHTER DUO 😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/NUThVasaAG Our favourite duo.

Fans needn’t be too bereft, though, as a second run was confirmed before the first was even finished airing. The first eight episodes of The Last Of Us are now available to watch on Now, with new episodes every Monday. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
