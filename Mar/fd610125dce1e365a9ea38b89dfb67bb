Rishi Sunak has faced an online backlash after promoting his immigration crackdown from behind a lectern emblazoned with the words ‚Äústop the boats‚Äù. The prime minister described his policy as ‚Äútough‚Äù but ‚Äúnecessary and fair‚Äù as the government unveiled plans for fresh laws to curb Channel crossings. On Tuesday, it was confirmed new laws will stop people claiming asylum in the UK if they arrive through unauthorised means. Asylum seekers arriving illegally would be detained and face a lifetime ban on returning after they were removed. They would never be allowed to settle in the country or gain citizenship. But questions remain over whether the plan is legal ‚Äì with home secretary Suella Braverman admitting it may break international law as it might be ‚Äúincompatible‚Äù with the European Convention on Human Rights. Sunak spoke at a Downing Street press conference on Tuesday afternoon, and said: ‚ÄúPeople must know that if they come here illegally, it will result in their detention and swift removal. ‚ÄúOnce this happens, and they know it will happen, they will not come and the boats will stop.‚Äù  But will it? pic.twitter.com/tTvTQ0qPIW But many on Twitter took exception to the blunt slogan on the lectern, which some thought resembled the Covid-era branding of platforms, such as ‚Äústay at home, protect the NHS, save lives‚Äù.  Critics hit out at the ‚Äúaesthetics of abject moral depravity‚Äù, and how the phrasing sounds ‚Äúlike a plea, rather than a plan‚Äù. What an awful, dystopian hellscape they turn this country into more and more every day. https://t.co/ietYb3EIYa Ah, the aesthetics of abject moral depravity. https://t.co/vleunHV2lr Stop the boats, stay in France, save lives https://t.co/cLZwXzdoAt Bunker politics.

In 2022, a record 45,755 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel. More than 3,000 have made the journey so far this year. Home Office figures show 197 made the crossing on Monday ‚Äì the first arrivals since February 24 ‚Äì taking the total to date to 3,150.
