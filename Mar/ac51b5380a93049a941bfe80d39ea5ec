Comedian and aspiring MP Eddie Izzard has revealed she now alternates between her original name and a new moniker. The gender-fluid performer was interviewed on Matt Forde’s Political Party podcast on Monday evening, with Politico reporting that she publicly shared her new name during the conversation. Eddie – who announced in 2020 that she would be using “she/her” pronouns moving forward – reiterated this during the podcast interview, although she added she “doesn’t mind” it when people use “he/him” pronouns to refer to her. “I’m Eddie,” she explained, before adding: “There’s another name I’m going to add in as well, which is Suzy, which I wanted to be since I was 10. I’m going to be Suzy Eddie Izzard.” Politico reporter Dan Bloom tweeted on Monday that Eddie then added: “That’s how I’m going to roll, so people can choose what they want. They can’t make a mistake, they can’t go wrong.” During a wide-ranging interview with HuffPost UK published in 2021, Eddie said of her pronouns: “I spent 50 years predominantly in boy mode, so let’s try the next 50 in girl mode.” “It’s just a language adjustment,” she added later in the interview. “And no one should get het up about it.” She also stated: “I’m still gender fluid and I tell everyone that’s supported me, ‘Relax people, he or she, it doesn’t really matter.’ The pronoun thing isn’t the important thing, the important thing was coming out [as trans] back in 1985, that was the tough time.” During her interview with Matt Forde, Politico quoted Eddie as saying: “Some people have been transphobic when I was going for the [MP] selection, coming out as trans was not easy back in 1985… “I don’t know [how many genders there are], we’re all somewhere on the spectrum, we have just got to chill out about it.”
