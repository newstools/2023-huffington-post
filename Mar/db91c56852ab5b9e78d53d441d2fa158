Oscars Live-Blog: Read HuffPost’s Live Updates On The 2023 Academy Awards When it comes to red carpets, they don’t come any more A-list than the Oscars. On Sunday night, the biggest names from the world of film gathered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood to find out which stars were being honoured at the 95th Academy Awards. Going into the night, frontrunners for the night’s top prizes included Michelle Yeoh, Cate Blanchett, Brendan Fraser, Austin Butler, Angela Bassett and Jamie Lee Curtis – and they were all on the guestlist. Other HuffPost faves in the running for this year’s acting awards included Paul Mescal, Stephanie Hsu, Colin Farrell, Ke Huy Quan, Barry Keoghan, Stephanie Hsu and Andrea Riseborough – not to mention Lady Gaga and Rihanna, both of whom received recognition in the Best Original Song category. But as any regular awards show viewer will tell you, it’s not just about the nominees when Oscar night rolls around. While US talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was back on Oscars presenting duties for the third time, plenty of other A-list presenters put in appearances over the course of the evening, including last year’s winners Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur (although, for obvious reasons, one of last year’s victors was not present). Among the other stars presenting awards were Andrew Garfield, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Samuel L Jackson, Nicole Kidman, Pedro Pascal, Janelle Monáe, Harrison Ford, Florence Pugh and John Travolta.
