Alison Hammond brought some old Hollywood glamour to the Baftas red carpet on Sunday in a stunning billowing Bulgari dress. The This Morning presenter gave A-listers like Cate Blanchett, Florence Pugh and Viola Davis a run for their money in the style stakes in the stunning black, sparkly gown. Alison is co-hosting this year’s awards along with Richard E Grant, who is fronting the main show, while Alison is hosting the Bafta Studio. The all-new backstage area will give viewers an access-all-areas pass as she interviews the night’s winners straight after they’ve collected their gongs. Ahead of Sunday’s bash at London’s Royal Festival Hall, Alison admitted she was nervous but revealed her strategy was to befriend the A-list talent with booze and sweets.

As long as I have those, they will be my best friend. Basically I won’t let them go. She added: “I am really honoured and privileged [to be involved in the Baftas]. I just hope I do a good job, it is nerve-wracking. I don’t want to let anyone down.” See all the looks from the 2023 Baftas red carpet here.
