Ellie Goulding made a big impression on the Baftas red carpet on Sunday night. Or rather, her sleeves did. The Starry Eyed singer rocked up to the annual film bash at London’s Royal Festival Hall in a sheer grey dress with plunging neckline. But it was her gown’s sleeves that had everyone talking… That awful moment when you realise you've muddled inches and cms again.   #BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/5MXDpbRopu Ellie Goulding doing that thing you did as a kid in winter when it was really cold, when you pulled your jumper sleeves down to cover your hands.#BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/UvSDQsz4um Ellie Goulding just deflated sam smith costume for the BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/cinniUfFj1 Ellie Goulding looking like a shirt on the washing line #BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/VM5YzlSdrb Ellie Goulding is giving chic dementor 👌🏽🖤 #elliegoulding #BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/I0j4IADDR6 #BAFTAs Ellie Goulding Clearly influenced by that GREAT noted influencer of the 21st Century Sue White. #ifyouknowyouknow #GreenWing #SueWhite #Allthesearms pic.twitter.com/tOjmGpUWDA Ellie’s latest daring red carpet look comes just a week after she put in an appearance at the Brit Awards wearing a moulded breast plate. The singer presented the prize for Best New Artist alongside Tom Grennan at the ceremony, and her co-presenter appeared to have an unscripted moment discussing Ellie’s outfit. He remarked: “I love what you’re doing... are they your real boobs?” Ellie then responded: “These are not mine, no. I wish! Mine are a lot further apart.” The moment sparked much conversation on Twitter, with some viewers deeming the comment awkward and inappropriate. However, after noticing the backlash, Ellie took to Twitter to defend Tom, insisting they were “having a bit of fun”. She tweeted: “A word on Brit/ tit gate … I was wearing a beautiful breastplate, thank you all for appreciating it ;) My friend @Tom_Grennan is 100% an ally and we were having a bit of fun. No offence taken, no harm intended- and no other interpretations necessary x.” Tom then followed up, clarifying he and Ellie had previously been joking backstage, also apologising to those offended.
