Maybe we should all think about the thing we did to Ariana DeBose. The Broadway star and actor who won an Oscar for her performance as Anita in 2022’s West Side Story appeared to have deactivated her Twitter account on Monday after she opened Sunday night’s Baftas with a much-discussed performance. Ariana kicked the event off with a rendition of Sisters Are Doin’ It For Themselves and put her own spin on the classic track by including a rap verse shouting out the night’s female nominees. HuffPost has reached out her reps for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.  Ariana DeBose has deactivated her Twitter account after going viral for her performance at the 2023 #BAFTAs. pic.twitter.com/CTd2dvJW5o Twitter poked a little fun at the star after she rapped about all the women nominated for Baftas during the award show’s opening number. It didn’t help that while she rapped about each nominee, the camera panned to that specific actor and most appeared to exude a certain amount of awkwardness when their name was mentioned.  Sisters are doing it for themselves! The incredible @ArianaDeBose opens the 2023 #EEBAFTAs with an iconic performance! ✨ pic.twitter.com/G9YgKN2e1t Ariana, who admittedly performed the rap like any musical theatre pro probably would, also got a lot of attention for one cryptic line in which she said, “Angela Bassett did the thing.” In fact, the line was discussed so much that “Angela Bassett” trended on Twitter Monday, with mixed reactions. Some people made fun of the lyric… Grateful that we have a national holiday in America today to celebrate the fact that Angela Bassett did the thing  pic.twitter.com/Bun4jjpH7A "so....did a thing 😌" - angela bassett Ariana DeBose wasn’t lying!! Angela Bassett did do the thing pic.twitter.com/VhcmA5OMyc … While others seemed to appreciate Ariana’s over-the-top interpretation of it.  me when angela bassett wins her oscar pic.twitter.com/QDqO9erdG9 unfortunately I will be physically unable to pronounce Angela Bassett’s name any other way 😭 pic.twitter.com/Hsd9mluZ41 ANGELA BASSETT DID THE THINGGG, such a boppp😍😍 https://t.co/s82oVk5zwo pic.twitter.com/99d35xVCGd It’s unclear if this is why Ariana deactivated her account — and the bulk of the tweets about her rap are more in the spirit of light teasing than pure vitriol.  But there was enough chatter online about her rap that Bafta producer Nick Bullen told Variety on Monday that criticism of it was “incredibly unfair.” He told the outlet that Ariana “put the whole piece together” in a short amount of time with her team and worked closely with a musical director and choreographer. He said the rap was meant to celebrate “a great year for women in film” performed by “a woman of colour who is at the absolute top of her game.”  When asked by Variety if the mocking may be due to a culture clash or because people only saw the rap portion of her performance, he responded by saying that the rap was meant to resonate with “younger people” and “diverse groups” and not the “the traditional British award ceremony audience.” “I think a lot of people don’t like change, and there’s a view that the BAFTAs have to be this slightly stiff, traditional British, middle-England messaging,” he told Variety.  “But American awards shows have much more razzmatazz, much more showbiz, and perhaps a broader range of people being involved. We felt we’re not about revolution, we’re about evolution.” But, considering the jokes, we can’t really blame DeBose too much for wanting to do this kind of Angela Bassett thing to her Twitter account:
