While polls should always be treated with caution, Labour supporters celebrated the latest figures.  Critics pointed out that the survey contained many in the 24 to 49-year-old age bracket.  However, it follows two other polls published in the last 48-hours that have put Labour well ahead of the Tories.  A Deltapoll survey found Labour on a 22 point lead while a Redfield & Wilton poll put them on a 27 point lead. According to the YouGov poll, Keir Starmerâ€™s lead over Rishi Sunak has also increased to 13 points.  Participants were asked which party leader would make the best prime minister. Starmer is on 34% of the vote (+1) while Sunak is on 21% (-4).
