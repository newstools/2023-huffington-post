Whether it’s her homage to an iconic look from years gone by or her recent platinum blonde transformation, there’s no denying that Shania Twain has been having a lot of fun with fashion on the red carpet in recent history. On Sunday night, the chart-topping star kept the bold looks coming, making a big impression when she posed for photographers as she made her way into the Grammys. The Man! I Feel Like A Woman! singer was one of the presenters during this year’s ceremony, and certainly pulled out all the stops when it came to her outfit before the show. There was absolutely no missing Shania, who hit the red carpet in an eye-catching polkadot suit – which, naturally, was also covered in glitter. She paired the look with a bright red wig and a sky-scraping hat that would make Dipsy from the Teletubbbies envious. Of course, Shania is no stranger to the Grammy Awards. Throughout her decades in the spotlight, Shania has won five Grammys, with an additional 13 nominations to her name. Her previous wins include Best Country Song for Come On Over, taken from the album of the same name, and Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her seminal hit Man! I Feel Like A Woman!. On Friday, Shania released her first album in almost six years, Queen Of Me, which was preceded by the singles Waking Up Dreaming and Giddy Up.
