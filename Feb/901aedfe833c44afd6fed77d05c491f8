Orlando Bloom has opened up about some of the “challenges” he and fiancée Katy Perry face in their relationship. In a new interview with Flaunt, the former Pirates Of The Caribbean star discusses an upcoming project, which sees him tackling all kinds of physical challenges, from parachute-jumping and free diving to wingsuit flying. During the conversation, he admits that the California Gurls singer – who he refers to as his “baby mama and life partner” – is often “stressed” about his pursuits. “We’re in two very different pools,” the British actor told the magazine as part of their Cocoon issue. “Her pool is not a pool that I necessarily understand, and I think my pool is not a pool that she necessarily understands.” Orlando continued: “Sometimes things are really, really, really, challenging. I won’t lie. “We definitely battle with our emotions and creativity, [but] I think we’re both aware of how blessed we are to have uniquely connected in the way that we did at the time that we did, and there’s definitely never a dull moment.” Orlando and Katy first began dating in 2016, but announced their split a year later. After reuniting in 2018, the pair revealed they were engaged in 2019, and welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Daisy, in August 2020. The Lord Of The Rings star also has a 12-year-old son, Flynn, from his previous relationship with model Miranda Kerr, to whom he was married between 2010 and 2013.
