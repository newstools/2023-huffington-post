Titans of the music world, from Beyoncé, Adele and Harry Styles to Kendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny and ABBA are all set to battle it out for the top prizes at the 2023 Grammy Awards. Following the success of her chart-topping album Renaissance, Beyoncé is leading the way when it comes to this year’s nominations, with an impressive nine, while Kendrick Lamar is up for eight awards. Meanwhile, Adele and Brandi Carlile have each been recognised in seven different categories, while Harry Styles and Mary J Blige are among those with six nods for their musical efforts in the past year. Because the organisers behind the Grammys try to honour musicians from as many different genres as possible, a wide array of awards is given out on the night, many of which don’t actually air during the main awards show. On Sunday night, the first awards were given out before the main ceremony even began, and here’s an abridged list of who won what. And make sure you keep checking back over the course of the evening, as we’ll be updating this list as more Grammys are awarded… Michael Bublé – Higher  Kendrick Lamar – The Heart Part 5  Beyoncé – Plastic Off The Sofa Ozzy Osbourne – Patient Number 9 Wet Leg – Wet Leg  Wet Leg – Chaise Long Viola Davis – Finding Me
