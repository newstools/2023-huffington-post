History was made at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, where Everything Everywhere All At Once was the big success story of the night. Three of the multiverse epic’s stars took home awards during the ceremony, with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan making history in the process as the first Asian actors to be named Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. The film itself also scooped Outstanding Performance By A Cast In A Motion Picture, while Jamie Lee Curtis pipped Angela Bassett, Hong Chau, Kerry Condon and co-star Stephanie Hsu (the same four women she’s up against at the Oscars next month) to be named Best Supporting Actress, marking her first SAG Awards win in her career. Meanwhile, when it came to the television categories, The White Lotus came out on top with two wins, including another victory for Jennifer Coolidge.
