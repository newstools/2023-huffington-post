Last week marked a decade since Jennifer Lawrence famously fell over on her way to collect her Oscar, and it seemed Jessica Chastain was feeling a bit nostalgic at this year’s Screen Actors Guild Awards. During Sunday night’s ceremony, it was revealed that the Zero Dark Thirty star was the recipient of a SAG Award for her performance in the drama George & Tammy, based on the life of country music icon Tammy Wynette. Unfortunately for Jessica, her bright pink dress proved to be troublesome as she made her way onto the stage, leading her to fall over as she climbed the stairs. It wasn’t all bad, though, as Courtney B Vance and Paul Mescal were both at hand to help her out in the moment.

I am honoured to be able to bring the story of George & Tammy to you. I loved playing Tammy Wynette.” The shock of last night really swept me off my feet! 😅 To my fellow SAG members, THANK YOU.
