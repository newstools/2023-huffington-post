If there’s one thing we knew we could count on from Sam Smith at this year’s Grammys it was to serve up some drama on the red carpet. On Sunday night, the chart-topping star was among the A-list attendees at the event, where they were nominated in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category for their Kim Petras collab Unholy. But before the show – which also included a performance of Unholy – got underway, Sam and Kim certainly made an impression on the red carpet. Backed by a fabulous entourage, including RuPaul’s Drag Race stars Violet Chachki and Gottmik, Sam sported a head-to-toe red ensemble, complete with an oversized cape, top hat, cane and red mesh over their eyes. Kim also got the all-red memo, which included a full-length veil and eye-catching bejeweled necklace.  While 2023 marks Kim Petras’ first time being nominated for a Grammy, Sam is no stranger to the awards show. In 2015, they scooped an impressive four awards in one night, including the coveted Best New Artist, Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year prizes. However, their latest nomination comes following an eight-year absence from the Grammys. Last month, Sam released their fourth album Gloria, which debuted at number one here in the UK. The release was preceded by the singles Love Me More and the chart-topping Unholy, while album cut I’m Not Here To Make Friends caused something of a stir upon its release last week thanks to its accompanying music video.
