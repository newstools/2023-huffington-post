If you were down the pub instead of being at home watching the Brit Awards on Saturday night, you missed out.  There were plenty of memorable moments as the stars descended on London‚Äôs O2 Arena for the biggest night in the British music calendar.  There were incredible performances from the likes of Harry Styles, Lizzo and Sam Smith and Kim Petras, as well as some amazing red carpet looks and a couple of political moments.
