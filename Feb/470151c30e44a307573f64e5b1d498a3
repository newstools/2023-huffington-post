Burt Bacharach, the songwriter behind some of the most iconic hits of the 20th century, has died at the age of 94. The music icon died at his home on Wednesday of natural causes, his publicist has confirmed to the Associated Press. In 1958, Burt landed his first UK number ones with Michael Holliday’s The Story Of My Life and Perry Como’s Magic Moments, both of which were co-written with his frequent collaborator Hal David. Burt’s many additional hits included I Say A Little Prayer (popularised by Aretha Franklin), Anyone Who Had A Heart (recorded by both Dionne Warwick and Cilla Black) and Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head (made famous in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kids). Other popular songs he composed in his lifetime were Walk On By, Do You Know The Way To San José, Alfie, That’s What Friends Are For and (They Long To Be) Close To You, which became a hit for The Carpenters in 1970. Over the years, Burt picked up six awards at the Grammys, as well as three Oscars for his musical contributions to the films Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Arthur. He continued to record and tour well into his late 80s, and released his final album – a collaboration with fellow musician Daniel Tashian – in 2020. Burt is survived by his fourth wife, Jane Hansen, to whom he had been married since 1993, as well as his children Oliver, Raleigh and Cristopher. He was preceded in death by his daughter Nikki Bacharach, whose mother was Burt’s second wife, the actor Angie Dickinson.
