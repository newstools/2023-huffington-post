Do you remember when Mike died from Desperate Housewives? How about when you found that Gossip Girl was in fact, Dan Humphrey? Or when Wes was killed off How To Get Away With Murder? And the brief period of time when Rachel and Joey from Friends tried to be a thing, ew. A thread on Twitter is going viral after asking this simple but controversial question: “If you could erase any storyline from these TV Shows/Movies, which storyline would you get rid of?” Nothing can replace our favourite TV show, but we can all admit there were a few storylines that should have never made it to our screens. But I guess that’s what also makes these shows brilliant – some of these stories were insane but we still loved these TV shows either way.  The thread is causing a few debates but nevertheless, it’s reminding us why these TV shows still hold a special place in our hearts. Here are the storylines we wish never happened.  Gaby’s baby being switched at birth, I just can’t stand that storyline https://t.co/mkF5DaIxtt Gabby sleeping with the underaged gardener 😭😭 https://t.co/fKmNLebYuk Edie and Carlos just never needed to happen https://t.co/icnnCejeSU Edie’s death. It should’ve been Susan and I said what I said. https://t.co/eJAphPcXtG Carrie shouldn’t of ended up with Big. IRL that wouldn’t of happened. The show should’ve ended with the message that your girlfriends are all that really matter tbh. https://t.co/K6Razf05t2 This: https://t.co/1BnMnJp9Zt pic.twitter.com/teOBX4fiBO Making us watch 6 seasons and 2 movies just to kill off the love of her life was CRAZY https://t.co/QAqleJECzH They could have left Carrie in France and went on with the three of them. They had better things going on. https://t.co/RHdebt3vJ5 Maybe BIG just shouldn’t exist idk he’s bringing bad vibes to every episode https://t.co/Jg0P53uNYE So sorry--miranda getting pregnant and having a baby. it goes against everything her character was and I never watch past the birth of brady https://t.co/e4fpWePl9T Michael rising from the dead https://t.co/xifVtpWIJN Rafael was not it, like yes he was attractive but the way he would talk to her WHEW! I was putting Michaels name on the birth certificate https://t.co/IUnSTG0CI8 jane should’ve say yes to rafael when he proposed and never married michael https://t.co/sNsAVp8YWt Jane ending up with Rafael. TEAM MICHAEL. https://t.co/oG51LLphFn Michael coming back as a farmer with amnesia? Idk that didn’t make any sense. I think his death was a bittersweet and it should’ve been left alone. Also I hated Jane with Rafael he treated her terribly and always got away with it bc he had a pretty face. https://t.co/FvOMRqBQJs Them gradually ruining Issa & Nathan's chemistry in the last season just so she could end up with Lawrence. https://t.co/0bya4aZTgV issa and molly being friends again. my ideal ending would be issa finding friends who actually love and accept her for who she is. https://t.co/q0jKqRetCa Issa ending up with Lawrence and being a stepmom… wtf was that! https://t.co/PaESv5SSW6 In general Molly and Issa throwing digs at eachother then calling it accountability 😭 https://t.co/1arxulY7cE oh my god the entire show is made of useless and unnecessary storylines https://t.co/7MkOLyhJfJ the first episode with chuck trying to assault two girls bc of the way they acted like it never happened after https://t.co/jAbx3LJ5Rj dan and serena having a common sibling 😟 https://t.co/OYqNfHkKpa Get Vanessa OUT OF HERE😭 my god she was annoying as hell https://t.co/h6Pu9voWEK blair and dan dating lol what was that https://t.co/17cCqszhr5
