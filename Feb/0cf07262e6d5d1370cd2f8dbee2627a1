The shortlist for this year‚Äôs LGBT Awards has been announced ahead of the ceremony in June. The awards celebrate leading LGBTQ+ activists, celebrity figures and allies who have worked to advance the rights of LGBTQ+ people during the past 12 months.  Among the celebs making the shortlist this year are Harry Styles, RuPaul, Alison Hammond, Joe Lycett, Emma Watson, Sue Perkins, Alex Scott and Sir Rod Stewart. Anne-Marie, Lizzo, Rina Sawayama and Yungblud will battle it out for the Music Artist Of The Year gong, while Pose legend Billy Porter, The Crown star Emma Corrin and Welsh actor Luke Evans will go head-to-head in the coveted Celebrity Of The Year accolade. England stars and Euro 2022 winners Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Jill Scott are all in the running for the Sports Personality Of The Year award alongside fellow Lioness Demi Stokes and pundit Alex Scott. Joe Lycett is up for Media Moment Of The Year for capturing the world‚Äôs attention last year when he threatened to shred ¬£10,000 in cash unless football legend David Beckham cancelled his deal with World Cup hosts Qatar.  The comedian‚Äôs actions came as a protest against the fact homosexuality is illegal in the Middle Eastern Nation with questions also being raised over the deaths of workers helping to build stadiums to the event.  Beckham failed to respond to the threat and Joe subsequently posted a video of himself appearing to shred the money. ‚ÄúA platform for progress‚Äù pic.twitter.com/EeMelv01nu The clip garnered huge amounts of media attention, only for the comic to reveal that the money coming out of the shredder was fake and he had donated the cash to Stonewall‚Äôs Rainbow Laces campaign and Sport Allies, before urging fans to give money if they could, too. Jack Rooke‚Äôs Big Boys on Channel 4, Ncuti Gatwah and Yasmin Finney on Doctor Who and Alex Scott‚Äôs One Love armband tribute in Qatar are also in the running for the Media Moment prize ‚Äì won by Johannes Radebe and John Whaite last year for their Strictly Come Dancing same-sex partnership.
