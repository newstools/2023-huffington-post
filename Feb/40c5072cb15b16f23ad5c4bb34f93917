Remember when Adele was at the basketball last year and sparked an instant meme with her complete and utter unbothered-ness when she was caught on camera? Well, sheâ€™s gifted us a moment that has surpassed that at this yearâ€™s Super Bowl.  The Someone Like You was in attendance at Sundayâ€™s game in Arizona, and the camera once again caught her serving up an absolute moment.  Wearing a stunning grey blazer, hooped earrings and a camp pair of oversized sunglasses, Adele was seen appearing to tell the men stood either side of her to zip it. Cameras caught the moment as she waved her hands and gestured to her companions to be quiet, before smacking her lips and staring straight ahead with a full, unbothered pout.

The highly-choreographed performance saw her take fans through some of her biggest hits including Bitch Better Have My Money, Only Girl (In The World), Work and Umbrella in a 12-minute set.  At the beginning of her performance, the singer also revealed to the world her baby bump, with her rep later confirming she is pregnant with her second child.
