The Brit Awards are a great opportunity to celebrate the biggest stars in music right now (and test ourselves on how many of them we’ve actually heard of), but they’re also a great source of nostalgia. With so many iconic performances and chaotic moments to look back on, whenever the Brits come around, we find ourselves reminiscing about previous ceremonies. With that in mind, we’ve rounded up 33 nostalgic photos from the event in 2003, which perfectly sum up what was going on at the Brits 20 years ago... This years Brit Awards will air live from London’s O2 Arena from 8.30pm on ITV1 and ITV Player.
