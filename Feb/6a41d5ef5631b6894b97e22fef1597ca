No disrespect to the line-up of The Masked Singer UK, but it’s not unfair to say that the show’s US counterpart has consistently outdone us when it comes to star bookings. But it seems even they still have a fair few tricks up their sleeve. During the show’s season launch, which aired in the States on Wednesday night, none other than Dick Van Dyke was unmasked, after performing a rendition of the standard When You’re Smiling in character as Gnome. 🗣 TAKE IT OFF!

So I walked around with my head covered with people leading me. They’ve got a nice crew, but I never got to meet any of them!” Dick was last seen on screen in the Disney sequel Mary Poppins Returns, in which he performed a tap-dance routine, and voiced a character in the US sitcom Kidding. Meanwhile, the finale of The Masked Singer UK is set to air over the weekend, with just three celebrities left in the competition.
