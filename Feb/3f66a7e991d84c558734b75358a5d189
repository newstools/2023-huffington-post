He was found dead at his home in Austin, Texas, his representative and friend Alex Gittelson told a number of news outlets. Cody was found lying unresponsive on his bed, the Los Angeles Times reported. His cause of his death had not been determined. “Cody was our whole world,” his wife, Stephanie Longo, said in a statement. “The kids and I are shattered and beyond devastated. He was the best dad and best father. We will always and forever miss you and love you.” His representative said in a statement to Fox News: “Cody was a dear friend, and my heart breaks for his amazing wife and kids. He was such a loyal, loving and talented person, and he will be greatly missed.” Cody began acting as a teenager.
