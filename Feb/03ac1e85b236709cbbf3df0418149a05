40 million Ukrainians have lived through a year of terror. And although the Russian-Ukrainian war has been going on for 9 years, its bloodiest page was turned on that very day. No matter who you ask in Ukraine, they will describe their February 24th to you in seconds. It is impossible to forget. And with a high probability, they will also tell you that you adapt to it within a week because you just want to believe that it will not get worse, but it does. Russia proves it every day. The Russian Federation deliberately chose terrorist attacks against the civilian population as a tactic of this war. From the first day of the full-scale invasion, when no one greeted the aggressor’s troops with flowers or appreciated the parade uniform of the invaders, which they carried with them, Ukrainian civilians began to be destroyed physically and very brutally. We can talk about the moral qualities of the soldiers of the Russian army and what they are capable of against civilians, but let’s also understand that they were not prohibited from doing this. Their command, the command of their command, and so on in a chain to the towers of the Kremlin, deliberately ordered not to spare civilians. And we have one year of evidence for this. Unfortunately, this list of terrorist attacks committed by the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine is incomplete and unfinished. The war continues, and shelling, war crimes, and missile strikes do not stop. And the world cannot be silent or just condemn. This was not enough in 2014 and it is critically insufficient now. We must call a spade a spade: Russia is a terrorist state. This has already been recognised by the European Parliament, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and the NATO PA. It has also been recognised at the national level by Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and the Netherlands. But this must be recognised by every country that respects human rights and fundamental democratic values. Can we imagine some European company giving ISIS cutthroats canned corn? Or the minister of foreign affairs of an EU member state travelling to negotiate peace with those who publicly executed people? No. So why should there be a different attitude towards Russia, whose soldiers shoot, torture, rape, and direct rockets at civilians? You can’t negotiate with a terrorist, you can’t do business with a terrorist, you can’t receive representatives of the terrorist regime, let its athletes go to the Olympics, or go to the concerts of its artists. Terrorists must be fought. To deprive them of the means to carry out terrorist attacks, that is, to confiscate their money. Terrorists thrive on impunity. Russia is an excellent example of this. And if democracy does not show its teeth now, and does not ensure a fair punishment for the aggressor, February 24th may happen in another country, and we cannot allow that. 01/03/22 | Kyiv, shelling of the TV tower: 5 people died. 01/03/22 | Kharkiv, rocket attack on the city: Philharmonic Hall, Opera House and the Kharkiv City Council damaged. 29 people died.
