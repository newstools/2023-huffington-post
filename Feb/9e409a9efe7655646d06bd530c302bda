May I compare thee to a summer’s day? Okay, we get it, writing a love letter or poem can be super stuffy and more than a little bit cringe. However, with AI starting to infiltrate every aspect of our daily lives, a recent report saw a whopping 71% of UK people surveyed fall for a ChatGPT love letter versus one written by a human. McAfee’s ‘Modern Love’ research report surveyed 5,000 people across nine countries to discover how AI and the internet is changing love and relationships. Think you’re better than the majority?

Now for the second. Poem 2: Carry your heart with me (I carry it in my heart) I am never without it (anywhere I go you go, my dear; and whatever is done by only me is your doing, my darling) I fear no fate (for you are my fate, my sweet) I want no world (for beautiful you are my world, my true) and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant and whatever a sun will always sing is you Now be honest with yourself, which one of the two did you prefer?
