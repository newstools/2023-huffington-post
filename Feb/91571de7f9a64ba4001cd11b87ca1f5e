Harry Styles has emerged as the big winner at this year’s Brit Awards.  The As it Was singer walked away with four prizes during Saturday night’s ceremony, hosted at London’s O2 Arena.  The former One Direction star picked up the prestigious Album Of The Year gong for Harry’s House, Song Of The Year for As It Was, Best Pop/RnB Act and the Artist Of The Year prize, which proved controversial this year after no female acts were shortlisted.  During his acceptance speech for the Artist gong, Harry said he was “very aware of my privilege” and said the award was for Rina Sawayama, Charli XCX, Florence Welch, Mabel and Becky Hill. Indie band Wet Leg and Beyoncé were also among the night’s biggest winners. Wet Leg took home Best New Artist and Group Of The Year, while Beyoncé was awarded International Artist and International Song Of The Year for Break My Soul.
