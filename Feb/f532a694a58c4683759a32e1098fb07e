Superbowl Sunday finished with a bang as Rihanna announced her pregnancy during the half-time show. Fans have been waiting for Rihanna to release new music for years and hoped that this performance would be a gateway into a new album. However, with a new baby on the way, it’s safe to say we aren’t getting a new album or tour from Rihanna anytime soon. Yes, we are all happy that Rihanna is having another baby, but what about the fans? Shall we just accept that Rihanna’s music days are over? It seems so and the fans aren’t happy about it.
