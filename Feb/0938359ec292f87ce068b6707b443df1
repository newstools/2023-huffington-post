Kylie Minogue returned to the stage in her native Australia on Friday as she headlined the official opening party of World Pride 2023. The pop princess treated the 20,000-strong sell-out crowd to some of her biggest hits in the 30-minute set, including classics like Spinning Around, Slow and Can’t Get You Out Of My Head. But Kylie really did save the best until last for the thousands of fans packed into The Domain in Sydney. As she closed the show with her chart-topping single All The Lovers, the 54-year-old was joined on stage by her sister Dannii, much to the delight of the crowd and people watching the live stream around the world. kylie and dannii minogue - all the lovers | sydney world pride | 2023 pic.twitter.com/8teiDK1w4A That Dannii reveal in the Kylie #SydneyWorldPride2023 gig was the Gayest thing I've ever seen.

Dannii actually became a household name in her native Australia before her sister, after being a regular performer on the 80s kids show, Young Talent Time. Also performing at Friday’s World Pride event were British singer Charli XCX and Australian artist Jessica Mauboy, while Australian singer Casey Donovan and Drag Race fave Courtney Act hosted the event. Organisers of World Pride expect about 500,000 people to attend the event. World Pride 2023 coincides with the 50th anniversary of the first Australian Gay Pride Week, the 45th anniversary of the Mardi Gras Parade and the fifth anniversary of marriage equality in Oz.
