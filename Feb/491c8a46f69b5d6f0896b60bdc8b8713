Adele’s acceptance speech at this year’s Grammys may not have been a long one, but she still managed to squeeze a lot into it. During Sunday night’s ceremony, the chart-topping singer was awarded Best Pop Vocal Performance for her hit single Easy On Me – a prize she clearly wasn’t expecting to come away with. “Thank you,” Adele began after taking to the stage, admitting she actually “was really just looking forward to coming tonight.” Dedicating the award to her 10-year-old son, Angelo, Adele became tearful, before admitting: “Oh god, Rich [Paul, Adele’s partner]  said, ‘if you win anything tonight, don’t cry’, and here I am crying.” Reflecting on the creation of Easy On Me, Adele continued: “I wrote the first verse in the shower when I was choosing to change my son’s life, and he’s been nothing but humble and gracious and loving to me the whole time. “And I love a piano ballad winning any kind of award because it’s very old school and very brave.” .@Adele gets emotional during her #GRAMMYs acceptance speech as she dedicates her win to her son Angelo. 😭#GRAMMYs pic.twitter.com/QKrcExw9Ld To conclude her speech, Adele forced the Grammys censors to act quickly as she declared she “fucking loved” the artists in the room, before leaving the stage. The Someone Like You singer’s latest Grammy win is her 16th overall, which includes two previous wins for Album Of The Year. Adele was also nominated in that category in 2023, alongside Beyoncé, Lizzo, Kendrick Lamar and ABBA, although it eventually went to fellow Brit Harry Styles.
