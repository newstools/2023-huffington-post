If the rumours that he‚Äôs set to replace Ken Bruce on his mid-morning weekday slot on Radio 2 are true, then Vernon Kay is set to get a very warm welcome from listeners. The well-known TV presenter will reportedly take over from the broadcasting veteran following the announcement last month that Ken would be stepping down after 31 years at the station. Vernon, who is celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary to Strictly Come Dancing presenter Tess Daly this year, started out as a model before going on to present various shows on Channel 4‚Äôs T4 as well as ITV programmes, including All Star Family Fortunes. The 48-year-old also presented his own BBC Radio 1 show between 2004 and 2012, and another on Radio X between 2015 and 2017. He has previously filled in for other Radio 2 presenters including Zoe Ball and Scott Mills. On Friday, the Sun reported that contracts had been signed last week, with Vernon apparently set to present his first show on Monday 3 April. While some listeners went as far as threatening to stop listening to the station, the vast majority welcomed Vernon‚Äôs rumoured appointment, jumping to his defence on social media... Yes, it is sad that Radio 2 are losing Ken Bruce as a presenter. He's brilliant. However, I think that Vernon Kay is a great replacement. To all of the people who say that they won't listen any more, that's your choice. Bye. No-one is going to be able to replace Ken Bruce. It‚Äôs going to be different, but different isn‚Äôt always bad.Vernon Kay is a good shout. Solid, dependable, experienced broadcaster.And unlike what happened with Steve Wright, Ken‚Äôs just a flip of a metaphorical dial away. Vernon Kay is exactly the right person to replace Ken Bruce. He‚Äôs put in the hours as a stand-in, he‚Äôs Gen X so totally the right Radio 2 demographic, he‚Äôs a seasoned broadcaster, he‚Äôs entertaining, and he‚Äôs got great taste in music.

The news was shortly followed by confirmation that the 72-year-old will be moving to the Bauer station Greatest Hits Radio in April to present a brand new mid-morning show from 10am to 1pm. Ken said he would ‚Äúalways be proud‚Äù of his association with the BBC and Radio 2, but that he wanted to continue his career ‚Äúin a slightly different way in the next few years‚Äù. The radio DJ first joined the corporation in 1977 as a BBC Radio Scotland presenter and his first regular slot on Radio 2 was the Saturday Late Show in 1984. The following year he fronted the Radio 2 Breakfast Show, taking over from Sir Terry Wogan. He later moved to mid-mornings in 1986 and after a brief stint on late nights and early mornings, he returned to mid-mornings in January 1992. Ken has also presented Radio 2‚Äôs coverage of Eurovision since 1988, and has been a regular presenter of Sunday Night is Music Night. HuffPost UK has contacted Vernon‚Äôs rep for comment.
