Paul Rudd has admitted it was a “surreal” experience to play a part in the Friends finale. The Ant-Man star joined Friends in its penultimate series as Mike Hannigan, a new love interest for Phoebe Buffay, who Lisa Kudrow’s character eventually went on to marry. Because of his character’s connection to the core six, Paul was part of the Emmy-winning sitcom’s final episode back in 2004, which he has now admitted he had mixed feelings about. Asked about his time on Friends during a recent interview with the Heart breakfast show, Paul said: “It was really fun, and they were great! The whole thing was a bit surreal. I must say.” He continued: “I never knew that I was going to be in as many [episodes] as I was. But it also felt strange. “I mean, I was in that last episode. And I just thought, ‘I shouldn’t be here... I’m getting, like, a front row seat to things I’m not supposed to see’.” “They were all crying,” he added. “It was all emotional. I was just like, ‘woah’. “I mean… I felt very privileged, but I also was like, I just don’t want to sit back here and get in that way.” Paul Rudd says he 'shouldn't have been' in the #Friends final episode...😲 pic.twitter.com/Ve7An6rLHH Paul is currently in full promo mode for the new Marvel film Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, which marks his third outing at the helm of the Ant-Man franchise.
