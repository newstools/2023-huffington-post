We might not have many tomatoes, cucumber or peppers right now, but we do have an abundance of dry British humour to spare. Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons have all announced they are rationing salad ingredients for a few weeks, supposedly due to poor weather in southern Europe. ‚ÄúLike other supermarkets, we are experiencing sourcing challenges on some products that are grown in southern Spain and north Africa,‚Äù an Asda spokesman explained. ‚ÄúWe have introduced a temporary limit of three of each product on a very small number of fruit and vegetable lines, so customers can pick up the products they are looking for.‚Äù Sainsbury‚Äôs, Lidl and Waitrose are yet to introduce restrictions on how many vegetables consumers can buy at a time, but experts have warned that these delays could last for weeks. Still ‚Äì Twitter is managing to see the funny side of this pretty bleak period. For instance, the jokes about Liz Truss and the lettuce which outlasted her have returned. Lettuce and tomato shortage leads to debate over whether Brexit is to blame, sparking angry exchanges on Facebook between leaf and romaine supporters. Worried that with everywhere rationing salad, Liz Truss won't have any real political opposition if she tries to rise to power again. Others are going back to basics, and bargaining off their fresh produce.

You didn't like Polish nurses, so now you can't have cucumbers. "Who needs tomatoes. We have sovereignty." Former Brexit secretary and current deputy PM Dominic Raab got an unflattering mention.
