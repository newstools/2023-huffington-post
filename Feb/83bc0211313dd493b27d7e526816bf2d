The stars were out in force at Sunday night‚Äôs 64th Grammy Awards, which will go down as one of the most memorable year‚Äôs in the annual music event‚Äôs history. BeyonceÃÅ became the most-awarded artist in Grammys history, with her four wins taking her tally to a record-breaking 32 Grammys, and man-of-the-moment Harry Styles took home the highly-coveted Album of the Year award for his third long-player, Harry‚Äôs House. Viola Davis became only the 18th star in history to reach EGOT status, adding a Grammy to her mantelpiece alongside her Oscar, Emmy and Tony awards, and Kim Petras became the first transgender artist to win the Best Pop Duo/Group Collaboration Grammy. There were also gongs for Adele, who won her 16th Grammy, as well as Lizzo who won Record of the Year for her global hit, About Damn Time, and her speech upon collecting her gong was one of the most joy-filled of the evening. With so many firsts, there was so much to celebrate, resulting in a truly joyous night... at the end of the day beyonc√© made history and won 4 grammy‚Äôs she won regardless it was her night pic.twitter.com/0npBu2WbRK things Beyonc√© achieved tonight:‚Äìfirst black woman to win best dance album‚Äìfirst Beyonc√© album to win Grammy‚Äôs without visuals‚Äìmost awarded grammys artist of ALL TIME pic.twitter.com/Og9SUNzI2T Beyonc√© wasn‚Äôt even alive when the Grammy‚Äôs were established and she has now won the most amount of awards in ceremony‚Äôs history. the work ethic? excellence? ohhhh we will NEVER get another her At this point, no one is EVER gonna have 32+ grammy's EVER again but Beyonce. watching the grammy‚Äôs is really fun when you‚Äôre on everybody‚Äôs team bc there‚Äôs never any disappointment and you get to watch the timeline collapse while stans call each other ugly I love twitter on grammy‚Äôs night üèº it‚Äôs so fun Im sorry the Grammy‚Äôs brought back my award show fever the audience was love, people are having fun, like this has been an amazing night.
