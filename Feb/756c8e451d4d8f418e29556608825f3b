Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday echoed a call from his father that presidential candidates “take a full & complete Mental Competency Test” in order to run for office.  “He did this himself when he was president,” the eldest son of the ex-president wrote in sharing the message from Donald Trump’s Truth Social page.  But critics quickly pointed out that the ex-president didn’t take a “mental competency test,” or at least didn’t announce the results if he did. Instead, he took something called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MoCA, which is used to check for signs of cognitive impairments that could be an indication of dementia. “It is supposed to be easy for someone who has no cognitive impairment,” Dr. Ziad Nasreddine, who invented the test, told MarketWatch in 2020. It asks the subject to do things like to identify an elephant, or remember and then repeat five words ― which, in Trump’s case, were “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV.”  Trump boasted that his doctors were stunned by his ability to recall the words.  “They say, ‘That’s amazing. How did you do that?’ I do it because I have, like, a good memory,” he said in 2020. “Because I’m cognitively there.” On Tuesday, Trump Jr. bragged about his father taking the test:  He’s 100% right. He did this himself when he was president and he would have no problem doing it again. I don’t think we can say the same about the current occupant of the White House! pic.twitter.com/Kl5oX3H37b His critics fired back:  person. man. woman. camera. tv. haaaaaaaaa. The test was for dementia, you absolute chode. Thats right. He had to remember a bunch of words, right? I think they were:YourDadWillNeverLoveYou Imagine bragging that his father was able to identify an elephant in a picture, and he would have no problem doing it again. 🤦🏾♂️ Nearly half of Trump's own cabinet ended up coming to the conclusion that he wasn't mentally fit to serve as president. I have yet to hear that from anyone in Biden's cabinet, or any responsible Republican.I don't think this is the winning hand that you think it is.  pic.twitter.com/mg0DVjTEoI He bragged about being able to identify a f’ng elephant & memorize five words in order, Twitchy.In the meantime, he asked about injecting disinfectants, stared directly at an eclipse, said windmills cause cancer & that there were airports during the Revolutionary war.So don’t. pic.twitter.com/79kFpHP4cR Americans do remember how Donald Trump “aced” his “mental competency test.”The test would’ve admittedly been trying for any two year old, as it involved repeating “person, woman, man, camera, TV, in that precise order.That ability is of course, inherently Presidential.  https://t.co/t9Dm39BMEp
