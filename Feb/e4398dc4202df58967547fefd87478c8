After just about managing to drag myself through January, it’s safe to say that I’d love nothing more than to hibernate in my bedroom for the rest of this month.

So, to help me fake being a properly functional adult, I’ve rounded up a selection of my top time and energy-saving products that I’m relying on to help see me through these cold and dark months. If you’re also feeling exhausted, then hopefully they’ll be able to help you out, too....
