Ben Affleck became the internet’s favourite new meme after his appearance at the Grammys this weekend, and now his wife Jennifer Lopez has joined in the fun.  The former Batman actor sparked a string of jokes on social media over the wekened when he was seen looking a little less than enthused as he sat with J-Lo during the ceremony.  Despite Jennifer later insisting she had Ben had “the best time” at the US music event, she couldn’t resist a little joke at his expense as she promoted his latest film on Instagram.  Ben is one of the stars of Air alongside Matt Damon and Viola Davis, which Jennifer posted the trailer of on her account.  However, she also shared a screenshot from it where Ben has a similar expression to his infamous “Grammys face”.  Turning it into a meme, J-Lo captioned it: “My husband’s happy face.” The couple were also caught having a seemingly tense moment at the Grammys as host Trevor Noah performed a bit, which sparked much discussion on social media.  However, Jennifer insisted they had enjoyed themselves at the event, posting a montage of photos on Instagram with the caption: “Always the best time with my love, my husband.” Jennifer and Ben were originally together two decades ago, but ended up calling off their wedding, only to reunite in April 2021 and finally tie the knot later that year.
