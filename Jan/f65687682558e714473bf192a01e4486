The two actors share the screen in the epic comedy-drama Everything Everywhere All At Once, which earned Michelle her first Golden Globe nomination in the category of Best Actress In A Comedy Or Musical. During Tuesday night’s ceremony, the Tomorrow Never Dies star was announced as the recipient of the award, prompting a big reaction from her co-star.

ALWAYS a cheerleader. My Bae won a Golden Globe. Her first nomination and win.” On the red carpet before the Golden Globes, Jamie told Variety about how Michelle’s involvement in Everything Everywhere All At Once was a deciding factor in her signing up. “My agent said to me, ‘you know, it’s pretty out there’, and I was like, ‘yeah, but Michelle Yeoh is going to be in the movie, right?’. And he said ‘yes’, and I said, ‘yeah, I’ll do it’,’ she recalled. “The movie itself was less important to me, it was important that I understood who Deirdre [her character] was and I understood who Evelyn [Michelle’s character] was, and their relationship and their love story.” #GoldenGlobe nominee Jamie Lee Curtis says she agreed to do #EverythingEverywhereAllatOnce because Michelle Yeoh was in it. "It was important that I understood who Deirdre was, and I understood who Evelyn was and their relationship and their love story." https://t.co/ywZXlvQL4G pic.twitter.com/2y7LE8eEg5 Jamie was also nominated for her performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once in the Best Supporting Actress In A Motion Picture category. However, this award went to Angela Bassett for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever on the night.
