And if you haven’t, then you might want to buckle up for the next few months. In what will absolutely not be music to any parent’s ears, the UK’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said flu and Covid-19 are circulating at high levels still – and are likely to continue to increase in the coming weeks. Meanwhile high numbers of scarlet fever also continue to circulate.  So yes, lots of illness going around. And as every parent knows, it pays to be prepared. If you’ve ever been caught without Calpol in your cupboard during a time of household sickness, you’ll know the stakes are high indeed. If you’re feeling rough right now, we’re sorry. Taking care of kids when you’re sick is seriously tough. But here’s hoping something from this list can help you and your little ones get on the road to recovery.
