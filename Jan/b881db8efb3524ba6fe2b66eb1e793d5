Nadhim Zahawi was sacked yesterday morning over a seven-figure tax payment he made to HMRC while he was chancellor. The prime minister dismissed him for a “serious breach of the ministerial code” two hours after receiving a report by ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus. Rishi Sunak will desperately hope this draws a line under the issue, however a number of crucial questions still need to be answered. Labour is calling on the Sunak to “come clean” about what he knew about the affair and the Lib Dems have suggested Zahawi should resign as an MP. Here, HuffPost UK talks you through the major questions dogging the prime minister who promised his government will have “integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level”. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said Sunak must now “come clean” on the advice he was given about that appointment in the first place and why he “apparently ignored the warnings”.
