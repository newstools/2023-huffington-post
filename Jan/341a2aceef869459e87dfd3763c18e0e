Breaking from tradition, it was previously confirmed that two seasons of the ITV2 reality show would be airing in 2023, the first of which would begin in January. Well, anyone in need of a bit of winter sun can officially start getting excited ‚Äì with the Love Island returning to our screens on Monday 16 January at 9pm on ITV2.

A previous winter series of the show took place in the South African capital back in January 2020. The upcoming series has bigger changes than just a switch-up in location, though. Following the departure of presenter Laura Whitmore in 2022, Maya Jama will take over hosting duties for Love Island‚Äôs ninth series, having been a favourite for the job among fans of the show for several years. Laura‚Äôs husband, Scottish comedian Iain Stirling, will remain with Love Island as its narrator, a role he has held since the show began airing in 2015. Ekin-Su C√ºlc√ºloƒülu and Davide Sanclimenti were chosen as last year‚Äôs Love Island champions by fans, beating runners up Gemma Owen and Luca Bish, who have since gone their separate ways. In the months since last year‚Äôs series came to an end, Ekin-Su and Davide have landed their own ITV2 travel show, with the former currently in training for the next series of Dancing On Ice.
