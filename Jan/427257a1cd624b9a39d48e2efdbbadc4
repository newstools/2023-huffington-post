Prince Harry’s sit-down interview with ITV was beaten in the overnight ratings by the latest instalment of Happy Valley, it’s been reported. On Sunday night, the Duke of Sussex’s interview with ITV News reporter Tom Bradbury aired in the same time slot as the latest episode of Happy Valley, which returned for its long-awaited third series after a six-year break last week. The morning after, a tweet from the BBC’s entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba claimed that over a million more people watched episode two of the Sarah Lancashire police drama on BBC One than Harry: The Interview on ITV1. Citing figures from the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB), he stated that 4.1 million people watched Prince Harry’s interview live, while 5.25 million tuned in for Happy Valley.  Prince Harry's interview with Tom Bradby on ITV1 last night was beaten in the TV ratings by BBC One's Happy Valley, according to BARB overnight figuresPrince Harry (2100 - 2235) was watched by 4.10m TV viewers.

Over the course of his 90-minute ITV interview, Prince Harry made a string of surprising claims about his life as a member of the Royal Family, as well as commenting on recent news events like Jeremy Clarkson’s much-derided newspaper column about Meghan Markle. The interview was to promote Prince Harry’s new memoir Spare, which is finally released on Tuesday, although details from the book were leaked in the press last week after it mistakenly went on sale prematurely in some markets.
