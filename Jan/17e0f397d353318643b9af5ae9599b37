Grant Shapps today said “life and limb must come first” as he defended a controversial new anti-strike bill.  The Business Secretary was promoting the new law aimed at ensuring a minimum level of service in crucial sectors during industrial action. Shapps said the government want to end “forever strikes” and argued that the government’s legislation would bring the UK “into line” with other European countries. The move has sparked threats of legal challenges, while Labour has said it would likely repeal the legislation.

Shapps told GB News: “I’ll be introducing a minimum safety level bill, which will sort of say, ‘look, we will never withdraw the right to strike from people but when there are strikes on life and limb must come first, and there has to be a minimum safety standard put in place for that’.” He added: “We don’t really ever want to have to use that legislation. “In those most recent strikes, the Royal College of Nursing, the nurses, agreed a set national level of support. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get there with ambulances across the country, meaning there was a bit of a postcode lottery as to whether an ambulance would turn up in the case of something serious, like a heart attack or a stroke. “We can’t have that, so common sense tells us that we need to have minimum safety levels.” Health Secretary Steve Barclay is considering backdating next year’s NHS staff pay increase to prevent further strikes. He suggested that improvements in efficiency could “unlock additional funding”, leading to an increased offer for the 2023/24 pay settlement in the spring. Sara Gorton, from Unison, said there had been an “acknowledgement” that avoiding strikes would “involve a reach-back” into the current pay year. It raises the prospect that the pay deal for 2023/24, which is due to be agreed in time for April, could be backdated and applied to the final quarter of the 2022/23 financial year. Ministers have previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies. Prime minister Rishi Sunak will chair his first Cabinet meeting of in 2023 on Tuesday morning.
