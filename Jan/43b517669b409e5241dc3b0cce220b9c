If there’s one thing nobody prepares you for, it’s parenting teens. After years of your child needing you and adoring you, all of a sudden the roles reverse and you’re the one that needs and adores them, while they decide you’re now painfully embarrassing.  If you’re in the throes of raising a teen – or more than one (in which case you probably deserve a medal) – here are some heavily relatable tweets about what it’s like to be a parent through this phase. 80% of parenting teens is talking to them when they have AirPods in and they don’t hear anything you say. Looking at a couple boarding our plane who have a baby & they’re cooing and fussing & it’s lovely. I look at my teens who only talk to me to get a charged up power bank, money or to ask where something is & I want to say to couple “enjoy this precious time…” #travel #parenting My teenager & I had words this morning so a little while ago I texted him ‘I Love you’ he texted back ‘Thank you’ 😜#teenagers Parenting a teen means everything you like is stupid or weird. Parenting a teen is fun because you get to try and help someone who doesn't want your help and then get blamed for not helping them. Parenting a pre teen is so rewarding. I make her yummy food and she says grateful things like “how am I supposed to eat this” and “don’t look at me” In other news, parenting a teen requires a next level of patience 😭 Parenting a teen in one text pic.twitter.com/LBUmo3ri3f Parenting a teen is 99% being present and kind and loving, and 1% saying: "Are you a raccoon living in a sewer? Clean up those dishes!" No one tells you that parenting a teen means suddenly having someone in your home who doesn’t want to be around you as much. It’s natural and as it should be, but fuck if that doesn’t cut you to the core. Tell me you’re parenting a teen w/o telling me you’re parenting a teen: you briefly daydream about getting a nanny gig in order to feel adored and have a child talk to you. #truth You know your parenting skills are top notch when your teen calls you a f*cker by 7:30 in the morning Although it’s not easy, of my favorite parts of parenting a teen are the conversations. Whether funny or deep, they both hit different than with younger kids. Listen to your teenagers. Like REALLY listen. When they feel seen and heard it feels like you hit the parenting lottery. When I tell people I have #teenage daughters I get a funny look.. like I’m enduring life with awful people. My daughters are wonderful and these years are beautiful. It’s hard to BE a teen, not to be there for them. #parenting
