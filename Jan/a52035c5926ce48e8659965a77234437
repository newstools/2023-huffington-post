The mother of rugby union player Levi Davis made an emotional appearance on Wednesday’s edition of Good Morning Britain, to appeal for information about her missing son. Levi – who many might recognise from the 2019 series of X Factor Celebrity – has been missing since October last year. He was last seen leaving the Old Irish Pub on La Rambla, Barcelona, having arrived in Spain from Ibiza a day earlier. During Wednesday’s GMB, Levi’s mum Julie Davis told Susanna Reid: “Before he left, there was a message – I don’t know, maybe it was powers from up above – that said to me, ‘Give him a hug because you just don’t know if this is going to be your last chance’.”  Reaching across the desk to comfort her guest, Susanna pointed out that GMB reporter Nick Dixon had recently been in Barcelona, and had seen “so much effort being put into finding Levi”. “The police are on it, we’ve seen the signs around on lampposts, podcasts,” the presenter continued.  'That mother's instinct. Just before he left there was a message that said to me, give him a hug because you just don't know if this is going to be your last.'Julia Davis emotionally speaks about the last time she saw her son.

Lots of love.” At the end of the interview, GMB cut to an ad break, and when the show returned, guest anchor Ed Balls was seen presenting solo. He explained: “Susanna has just stepped out with our previous guest, Julie.” Following the segment, a post was sent on the official Good Morning Britain Twitter page, which read: “The family are appealing for anyone with any information on Levi’s whereabouts to come forward. Call 08001939333.” The family are appealing for anyone with any information on Levi's whereabouts to come forward.Call 👉08001939333https://t.co/JPUKjbU4VK Good Morning Britain airs every weekday from 6am.
