Whether it’s a strong gust of wind inverting your umbrella on a busy street, a spot you’ve squeezed leaving behind an enormous and noticeable red bump, or a stray bit of sauce finding its way onto your outfit at lunch, embarrassing situations seem to always find a way to ruin our days. So, I’ve scoured Amazon in search of some solutions to some of the most common embarrassing problems, and pulled together a range of products that are sure to help. And best of all, I’ve made sure to only select products that have hundreds (and in some cases, thousands) of five-star reviews.
