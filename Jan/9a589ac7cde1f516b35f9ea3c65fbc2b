Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication.With the drawn-out, dark evenings, tight post-Christmas budgets, and general sense of pressure to get the year off to a good start, the dreaded January blues have once again come knocking for many of us. And one of the main casualties seems to be our sleep — January is officially the worst month for it in the UK.  Analysis of YouGov data from the past five years by Cannabotech has revealed a shocking two in five adults fail to get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night in the first month of the year. Sleep-related Google queries are also highest in January — with search terms like “insomnia”, “why can’t I sleep”, and “sleeping pills” all peaking at the start of the year. I’ll admit I’m one of the sleep-challenged myself, which is why I’ve pulled together this selection of products to create a more restful bedroom environment, get my body into a proper bedtime schedule, and ensure I’m feeling comfy — all key to a good night’s sleep. I hope they work for you, too.
