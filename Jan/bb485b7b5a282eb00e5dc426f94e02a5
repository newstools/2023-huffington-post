Meat Loaf’s widow has shared a heartbreaking tribute to the US rocker on the first anniversary of his death, saying she wishes she could “rewind the clock and have you back beside me”. The musician, who became a global star thanks to hits including I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That) and Bat Out Of Hell, died aged 74 on 20 January last year, with his wife Deborah and daughters Pearl and Amanda by his side. On Friday morning, Deborah shared a tribute to the late singer on his official Facebook page. “Today is an especially sombre day for us all as we acknowledge the passing of my husband on January 20, 2022,” Deborah began. “I hope you don’t mind, but I put together a few words to express my sorrow and I am humbled to share them with you. “Oh, how I miss you and wish I could rewind the clock and have you back beside me. Not a day goes by that I’m not thinking of you. No doubt there’s a huge piece of me missing and that’s because you were such an integral and influential part of my life. “You could almost say we were joined at the hip because we shared so much together. Heck, you even enjoyed our grocery runs. It was especially hard getting you out of Costco though. You were like a kid in a candy store. “I am truly blessed to have shared 20 years with you, a life-long gift. I will always love you from the bottom of my heart!” The official Twitter account for Bat Out Of Hell the musical also remembered Meat Loaf on Friday.
