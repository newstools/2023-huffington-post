The Fablemans, Abbott Elementary, The White Lotus and Everything Everywhere All At Once were among the big winners at this year’s Golden Globes. After last year’s more subdued ceremony, which came as the Golden Globes were shrouded in numerous controversies, the awards show returned to US screens on Tuesday night, recognising the past year’s biggest films and TV shows. When it came to film, Steven Spielberg’s semi-autobiographical offering about his teenage years was the most-awarded, picking up a total of three awards. Just behind on two wins were the epic comedy-drama Everything Everywhere All At Once, which picked up two Golden Globes for cast members Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, and The Banshees Of Inisherin. Meanwhile, in the TV category, the US comedy Abbott Elementary led the way with two wins, while The White Lotus followed on two. Other wins included Austin Butler for his performance as Elvis Presley, Angela Bassett for her role in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Evan Peters for Netflix’s divisive miniseries Dahmer.
