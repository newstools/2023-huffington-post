After last year’s pared-back awards, the Golden Globes returned to US screens on Tuesday night, with a host of A-list talent walking the red carpet on their way into the event. Well, we say “red carpet”. It was actually more of a grey-ish brown type of carpet. But the point still stands. Some of the biggest fashion moments of the night were from Angela Bassett, who won a Golden Globe for her performance in the Black Panther sequel Wakanda Forever, Best Actress nominee Viola Davis and Margot Robbie. Meanwhile, repping the world of TV were Wednesday’s Jenna Ortega, Pam & Tommy’s Lily James and Abbott Elementary’s Quinta Brunson, who picked up the award for Best Lead Actress In A TV Comedy. And, as ever, we were happy to see male guests stepping outside the box when it comes to their red carpet fashion. You can always count on Billy Porter to give us a true fashion moment, while Eddie Redmayne, Andrew Garfield, Seth Rogen, Donald Glover and Abbott Elementary’s Tyler James Williams (another of the night’s winners) all opted for something a little more imaginative than the traditional black tuxedo. That being said, Best Actor In A Drama recipient Austin Butler kept it traditional with his black tuxedo, but still turned heads as he posed for photographers.
