UPDATE: Police ‘Looking Into’ Sunak Not Wearing Seatbelt In Video Rishi Sunak has said sorry for filming a clip in a moving car without wearing a seatbelt. A spokesman for the prime minister said he made an “error of judgment” by briefly removing his seatbelt in an Instagram video on a visit to Lancashire. He said Sunak “fully accepts this was a mistake and apologises”. “The prime minister believes everyone should wear a seatbelt,” the spokesman added. “It was an error of judgment, he removed it for a short period of time to film a clip, which you’ve seen, but he accepts that was a mistake.” Fines of up to £500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available. There are a few exemptions, including when a car is being used for police, fire and rescue services and for certified medical issues. It comes after Sunak was criticised for flying to Blackpool in a taxpayer-funded RAF jet rather than taking a train. Labour said Sunak’s video was adding to “endless painful viewing” after he was previously seen struggling to make a contactless payment with his card. “Rishi Sunak doesn’t know how to manage a seatbelt, his debit card, a train service, the economy, this country,” a spokeswoman said. “This list is growing every day, and it’s making for endless painful viewing.” Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “The fact he’s breaking a basic law is just embarrassing and frankly dangerous.” An AA spokesman said: “No matter who you are it is important to wear your seatbelt when in the car.”
