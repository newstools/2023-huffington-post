Boris Johnson has made a surprise visit to Ukraine as he faces fresh questions at home over his finances.  The former prime minister said it was a “privilege” to visit Ukraine as he was photographed in the town of Borodianka in the Kyiv region. Johnson said he had travelled to the war-torn country at the invitation of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “The suffering of the people of Ukraine has gone on for too long,” Johnson said in a statement. “The only way to end this war is for Ukraine to win – and to win as fast as possible. This is the moment to double down and to give the Ukrainians all the tools they need to finish the job. “The sooner Putin fails, the better for Ukraine and for the whole world.” Rishi Sunak’s press secretary said he is “always supportive of all colleagues showing that the UK is behind Ukraine and will continue to support them”. This trip comes as Johnson faces accusations that he allegedly recommended Richard Sharp for the BBC chairman job weeks after Sharp helped him secure a loan while he was still in No.10. Labour is calling for a parliamentary investigation into claims revealed in the The Sunday Times that Sharp was involved in arranging a guarantor on a loan of up to £800,000 for Johnson. Sharp said he had “simply connected” people and there was no conflict of interest and Johnson’s spokesman said he did not receive financial advice from Sharp. A spokesperson for Johnson dismissed the report as “rubbish” and insisted his financial arrangements “have been properly declared”.
