Prime minister Rishi Sunak has been fined for failing to wear a seatbelt while filming a social media clip in the back of a moving car. It is Sunak’s second fixed penalty notice, having been issued with a fine during the “partygate” scandal while chancellor. Lancashire Constabulary said on Friday: “Following the circulation of a video on social media showing an individual failing to wear a seatbelt while a passenger in a moving car in Lancashire, we have today issued a 42-year-old man from London with a conditional offer of fixed penalty.” A spokesperson for the prime minister said Sunak will pay the fine and “fully accepts this was a mistake and has apologised”. Fines of up to £500 can be issued for failing to wear a seatbelt when one is available. Sunak had apologised as Downing Street said he had made a “brief error of judgment” by removing the safety device when he visited Lancashire on Thursday. It was filmed and posted on Instagram.
