Sometimes the Internet can be a terrible place. But sometimes, it can really bring out the best in us. A father-to-be recently asked the social media masses for help as he and his partner prepare for the birth of their child. “What is one thing that your partner did, said or brought to the hospital that really helped you through your birth experience?” Dave Whiteside, a research consultant in Ontario, Canada, wrote on Twitter. He added that he is an “expecting dad hoping to support his wife in the best ways possible,” who’s ready to take notes. Among all the well-wishes for their impending arrival, the responses to his tweet ranged from super practical (bring snacks!) to the importance of advocating for birth partners when they’re struggling to advocate for themselves. Whether you’re a prospective birth partner – or perhaps you’re due to give birth and want to send your partner some pointers – here’s some of the best advice we gleaned from the tweet.
