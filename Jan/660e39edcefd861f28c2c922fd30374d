The Christmas holidays are well and truly over (for most people) this week, and normal life is resuming. But, after shutting off our brains and mindlessly eating mince pies / cake / turkey / nut roast / chocolate for the last two weeks, it’s not exactly easy – no matter how wholesome your new year resolutions are. Don’t worry though – you’re not alone. A quick look on social media suggests pretty much everyone is feeling the struggle this week. I've been a lady of leisure for 2 weeks.
