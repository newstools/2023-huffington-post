In a further sign of Moscow’s difficulties in Ukraine, 30-year-olds could be signed up as part of the Russian army’s spring 2023 draft. The current age limit for routine military conscription in Russia is 27. The idea was proposed by Andrey Kartapolov, the head of the Russian State Duma Defence Committee. According to the latest intelligence update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence, Kartapolov said the move would be intended to enable Russia to hit its target of increasing the size of its military by 30%.
