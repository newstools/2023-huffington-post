The BBC reality show Glow Up has announced it has a new host, following the departure of Maya Jama. Maya took over presenting duties from Stacey Dooley in 2021, but after it was announced she was the new host of Love Island, fans began speculating that she would not return for the makeup show’s upcoming fifth season. On Thursday morning, it was confirmed that Maya would not be back, with model, influencer and fashion designer Leomie Anderson taking over at the helm. 💄 On your marks, get set ...

Leomie added: “I can’t wait to work alongside the fabulous Val and Dom in a completely new territory too outside of modelling and get truly stuck in!” Maya began fronting Love Island earlier this month, and has already received a wave of praise from fans for her approach to presenting the show. A release date for the fifth season of Glow-Up is yet to be revealed, although the BBC has said it will be coming later this year. The first four series are available to watch on BBC iPlayer now.
