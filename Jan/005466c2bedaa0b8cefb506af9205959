Children who are “unwell and have a fever” should be kept home from nursery and school to try and reduce the spread of winter illnesses, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said. Flu and Covid-19 are currently circulating at high levels and are likely to continue to increase in the coming weeks, the health body said. Meanwhile high numbers of scarlet fever, which is caused by group A streptococcus, also continue to circulate. It’s been reported that 30 children in the UK have now died from invasive Strep A since September 19. Professor Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, urged parents: “If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better and the fever has resolved.” But what actually constitutes “unwell”? We’ve broken down when you can and can’t send your children to school, using advice from NHS Choices. The UKHSA’s Prof Hopkins added that helping children to learn about the importance of good hand hygiene is also key with various illnesses circulating. She encouraged parents to practise regular hand-washing at home with soap and warm water, as well as catching coughs and sneezes in tissues and then binning them. “Adults should also try to stay home when unwell and if you do have to go out, wear a face covering,” she said. People who are unwell should not visit healthcare settings or vulnerable people “unless urgent,” she said. Those who are eligible for free flu vaccines can still get them from pharmacies and GP practices. The UKHSA stressed it is “the best protection against the virus”. So far this season there has been good uptake in older age groups but vaccination among young children remains low.
